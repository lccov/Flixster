### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs did prepare me to complete the assignment. Since the project was essentially
building an more advanced version of the labs, there wasn't a feature that I felt completely unprepared because
I had the labs and other reasources available to look at.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would add a light/dark mode switch. I would also like to have an animation that when the user close the website, an animation of closing stage curtains plays on the screen before they're redirected.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Building the core features went really well; I was done with the core features before lunch on Thursday, which gave me more time to work on the CSS. Creating the CSS didn't go well; I believe that the styling of the page is very sub-par. Something I saw from others that I would like to try next time is create a light/dark mode switch, allowing people to browse based on genre, and having music play as the user scroll through movies.
